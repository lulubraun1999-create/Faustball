    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure prioritizes authorization independence and QAPs. The primary design decision is to segregate user data and member profiles. User authentication details (`users/{userId}`) are separated from member profile data (`member_profiles/{memberProfileId}`). This structure ensures clarity, simplifies security rules, and avoids hierarchical dependencies.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** No `get()` calls are needed in rules. User data and profile data can be secured based on the `request.auth.uid` without needing to read related documents.\n*   **QAPs:** Segregation allows secure `list` operations on each collection. For example, you can securely list all member profiles or only the current user's profile without exposing private user data.\n*   **Ownership**: `/users/{userId}` path-based ownership ensures that only the authenticated user has access to their own user document.\n*   **Predictable Schema:** Ensures a standard and consistent data structure for easier development and debugging."
